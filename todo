Bugs/Important Issues
- - - - - - - - - - -

- hide moves up until played (for training)

- jumps scrollwheel when adding variant

- focus lost bugs (keys l/r movesedit)
  1.) qt.conf in /Contents/ressources :
  [Path]
   Plugins=bollocks

- set focus to movesedit after load game (seems to work, check others)

- multiple uci engines

- just "save" in file menu(!)

- testing of game analysis

- remove printers

- after loading: N.N. (game data edit)

- move variant up

- blind/training mode

- compiled version: after loading a game focus lost
  then file load: crash (seems to only happen on mac)

- FIXED bug: -/+ doesn't work in analysis

- DONE priority level of qprocess (untested on windows)

- DONE switching eval (ie multiply * -1 ) must
  be synched to the current movenumber/line
  (no: but won't switch when info w/o score)

- DONE: save scroll level when entering
  move via boardview in scroll down state

- DONE bug: won't automatically enter move mode
  after analysis (need to update main window)

- DONE reset strength level in analysis mode
  (current saving of strength level and
   handling of game info is ugly, though)
 
- FIXED(?) bug: don't insert var with same move

- FIXED records better "mate" line and gives numbers
  instead of mate -> record mate as large eval number?

- LATER: responsiveness in analysis mode
  is this really an issue, when engine process
  is set to be lower than gui?

- FIXED bug: possible to enter move in analysis
  via board

- testing in general; code refactoring
  removing printers, more comments

- DONE edit game data when pasting


Long Term Roadmap
- - - - - - - - - - -

- width of messagebox according to message

- eco classification

- load full pgn files, not just first game

- engine output should show SAN or
  full algebraic notation, not 
  raw engine output

- FICS/ICC support

- use more frequently statusbar for messages

- computer: draw acceptance (either worse or equal,
  but at least some moves played!)
